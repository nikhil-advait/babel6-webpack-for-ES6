# webpack-black-triangle

Note: Tested this setup on node v4.2 (and not on v0.12)

A minimal setup to demonstrate use of webpack, babel6 to use ES6 in your project.

Read how it works at [jamesknelson.com](http://jamesknelson.com/write-es2015-with-instant-feedback-using-webpack-dev-server-and-babel/).

**Things it does**:

- Makes ES6 "just work"
- Serves your files
- Automatically recompiles/reloads your page when JavaScript/CSS files change


## Install with three lines

Just `git clone` & `npm install`:

```
git clone 'url'
cd to directory
npm install
```

## Then use it with one more

Run the dev server:

```
npm start
```

Then open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
