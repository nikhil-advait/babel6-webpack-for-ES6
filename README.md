# webpack-black-triangle

Note: Tested this setup on node v4.2 (and not on v0.12)

A minimal setup to demonstrate use of webpack, babel6 to use ES6 in your project.


**Things it does**:

- Makes ES6 "just work"
- Serves your files
- Automatically recompiles/reloads your page when JavaScript/CSS files change


## Install with three lines

Just `git clone` & `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/nikhilyeole1/babel6-webpack-for-ES6.git
cd babel6-webpack-for-ES6
npm install
```

## Then use it with one more

Run the dev server:

```
npm start
```

Then open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
